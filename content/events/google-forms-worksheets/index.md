This workshop will make your work easier by showing you how to create online/digital worksheet for your students using Google Form, a free online tool, with a variety of question types, such as short answer, long answer, multiple choice, checkboxes, dropdown, to select from. The course will enable you to:

- assign points, set answer key and add feedback for responses. The worksheet can either be instantly, automatically graded with scores revealed to the individual or you can provide feedback upon review.
- allow students to attach files/photos of their work where needed and you can also download all data collected from students.
